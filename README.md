docker-compose for Laravel 6.x
=======================

Ready made development environment for Laravel 6.x using docker-compose.

Don't spent hours managing dependencies anymore. Just docker-compose and git - your laravel project will be up and running in minutes!

What's Included?
------------------------  

The environment is composed with the following services -

- PHP 7.2 with fpm
    - All common dependencies for Laravel application
    - [Composer]
    - nodejs and npm for [Vue.js] and [Laravel-Mix]
    - ImageMagick + ghostscript (default) or gd (require uncommenting) for image operations
- [Nginx] - Web server
- [MariaDB] 10.2 - Database (drop-in replacement for MySQL with performance, stability, and openness)
- [Adminer] - Light-weight database management frontend
- [MailHog] - Receive emails for dev environment (Web and API based SMTP service)

How to use
------------------

I am assuming you have basic idea about how to work with [git], [docker] and [composer] based PHP projects.
Otherwise, following the steps may not be easy for you.

#### 1. Clone this repository 
You can clone it anywhere in your local machine or download as zip file.
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/ajaxray/docker-compose-laravel.git /tmp/docker-compose-laravel  
```

> If you want to try with fresh Laravel project, check "Starting with fresh Laravel" below in Notes section before proceeding to the next step.

#### 2. Copy required files to your project

Now, copy `docker-compose.yml` file and `docker` directory to project root of your laravel application.
```shell script
cp -vr /tmp/docker-compose-laravel/docker* /path/to/my-project/
cd /path/to/my-project/
```

#### 3. Adjust `.env` variables 

Edit the `.env` file in project root and set the following values:
```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=appuser
DB_PASSWORD=123456

MAIL_HOST=mailhog
MAIL_PORT=1025
```  
Alternatively you may update parameters in `docker-compose.yml` file and set `.env` parameters accordingly.

#### 4. Get up and running
 
Start containers from project root directory 
```shell script
docker-compose up -d
# Check service status
docker-compose ps
```

If everything went OK, you should see something like this -

That means your Development environment is ready! 
But we have one more step before checking the live application. 

#### 5. Generic Preparation for Laravel application 

These are generic steps to prepare any Laravel application, not specific to this Docker setup.
But you need to run them from inside appropriate container.   
(You may ignore any of the following commands if not required for your project.)

```shell script
docker-compose exec app composer install --no-interaction --no-suggest --no-progress --prefer-dist
docker-compose exec app php artisan key:generate
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed

# Required for Vue.js and laravel-mix
docker-compose exec app npm install
docker-compose exec app npm run dev

# Cache configuration. Recommended for production environment
docker-compose exec app php artisan config:cache
```


> ðŸŽ‰ Good News ðŸŽ‰  - **Your project is live by now!** 

Check it here:    

- Application: http://localhost:8080/
- Database frontend : http://localhost:8081/
    - root password: 123456
    - application database user: appuser
    - application database user's password: 123456
- Email Panel: http://localhost:8025/

The information above can be different if you've modified parameter values in `docker-compose.yml`.

Important Notes
---------------
- **Starting with fresh Laravel**  

    If you have not started (or cloned) the project yet, you can start a latest Laravel project using _ONLY_ git (no other dependencies):  
   ```shell script
   git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git my-project
   cd my-project
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
  
- **Updating PHP configuration**

    `docker/php/local.ini` is being loaded with PHP ini of `app` service. So, if you need to modify/add any ini value, you can use this file.

- **Updating Nginx configuration**

    All config files under `docker/nginx/conf.d/` will be loaded by Nginx. You can modify/add files here to modify Nginx config.  
    The application hosting is defined in `app.conf` of this directory. Check it to know log file locations and other configurations.
    
- **Updating Database configuration**

    `docker/mysql/my.cnf` is being loaded with database configuration of `db` service. So, if you need to modify/add any configuration, use it.
        
- **Connecting database from other database client**

    To avoid conflict with local MySQL (if any), database port mapped to `33061` for localhost. 
    That means, if you want to connect the database inside container from a database client, you have to use `33061` port.

- **Selecting Image library**

    ImageMagick and ghostscript is enabled by default. If you prefer GD instead, comment out ImageMagick section and uncomment GD section in `docker/php/Dockerfile`
    
- **Add/Remove/Modify services of docker-compose**

    If you need to add/remove/modify any service anytime later (after `docker-compose up`), feel free to do. 
    Just remember to run the following commands from project directory to apply your changes -
    ```shell script
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up --force-recreate --build -d
    docker image prune -f
    ```
